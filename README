This is version 1.1 of Module::Check_Args, a Perl-only distribution.

Module::Check_Args is a way to ensure that a subroutine or method is only
called with the number of arguments it expects.  You add a line at the
top of each subroutine or method for which you want to enable checking.
You can specify if you want the program to die if the arguments don't match,
or just give a warning, on a module-by-module basis.  You can also turn
checking off but leave the hooks in your subroutines.
